✔ React Components (Functional Components) ✔ JSX Basics ✔ Conditional Rendering ✔ Props ✔ State (useState) ✔ Side Effects (useEffect) ✔ Working with Arrays ✔ Working with Objects ✔ Styling in React (3 Types) ✔ Form Handling (Controlled Forms) ✔ Basic Todo App (CRUD) ✔ React Router DOM (Multiple Pages)
